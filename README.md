# Cyberlabs Project

Welcome to Cyberlabs - a set of cybersecurity training resources focusing on host-based and network security. This repository was first created as an aid for [CyberPatriot](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/) students to help establish a common set of training materials that can be accessible to all competitors, regardless of direct mentorship received. These lab guides are intended to cover the fundamental parts of host-based and network security that students may encounter both in a competition and in a real-world environment. Content is aimed at novice security practitioners with additional advanced concepts presented in a digestible way.

# Lab Resources

Lab guides with links to resources are all available here:
